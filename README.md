# escher-ripples
This is a WIP.

WebGL-based demo which draws ripples over things. You can use it to draw ripples over existing Escher etchings, or to draw ripples over... anything, really...

[Escher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_with_Reflecting_Sphere) [liked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puddle_%28M._C._Escher%29) [exploring](https://www.kingandmcgaw.com/prints/mc-escher/still-life-with-reflecting-sphere-400054) [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Worlds_%28M._C._Escher%29), and this demo allows you to manipulate [this piece in particular: Rippled Surface (1950).](http://www.mcescher.com/gallery/mathematical/rippled-surface/)

I would like to do something with [this piece](http://www.wikiart.org/en/m-c-escher/eye) next.
